# Gauss_Capital-Case_Caesars
Programming challenge for an Equity Reaserch's intership on Gauss Capital.

The challenge was based on developing a code that uses Selenium to scrap all reviews from a hotel on Tripadvisor website and make it into a csv file.

After srapping all 11 databases, we needed to analyze the performance of Caesars reviews from 2019 to nowadays comparing to it's 
competitors (peers) on the market.
